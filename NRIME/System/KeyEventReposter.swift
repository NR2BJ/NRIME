/// Constants for re-posting key events to the frontmost application
/// after committing composing text.
///
/// Problem: When an IMKit input method calls `client.insertText()` inside `handle()`
/// and returns `false`, the original key event is not reliably forwarded to the host app
/// (especially in Electron-based apps like Slack, Discord, VS Code, Claude for Desktop).
///
/// Solution: Engines commit text, then repost the key event as a tagged CGEvent.
/// The controller detects the tag in `handle()` and returns `false` immediately,
/// allowing the event to pass through to the host app untouched.
///
/// For Shift+Enter specifically, CGEvent repost is not used because Shift+Return
/// has no macOS StandardKeyBinding.dict entry — Chromium's interpretKeyEvents:
/// misinterprets it. Instead, engines insert "\n" directly via client API after a delay.

    /// Used by controller to detect and pass through reposted events.
